## Introduction

I have created this repository to allow me to practice data structures and algorithms in various languages. I am excited to partake in this endeavor as I will be able to develop my skills along with implementing various visualizations of said data structures. The first language I intend to focus on is Java, following with Python and Swift, for reasons. I will add instructions for cloning the repository and executing files in the primary languages. In terms of downloads and execution, I highly advise viewers curious to fork or clone my repository to do so in the documents folder. This will allow for easier interpretation of instructions and easier execution of programs. 

# Java

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory. 
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to compile. 
```shell
javac <folder-name>/<file-name>.java
```
The final step is to execute the code after it is properly compiled. 
```shell
java <file-name>
```

# Python

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory.
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to interpret and execute.  
```shell
python3 <file-name>.py
```

# Swift

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory.
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to compile and execute. 
```shell
swift <file-name>.swift
```
