# Introduction

I have created this repository to allow me to practice data structures and algorithms in various languages. I am excited to partake in this endeavor as I will be able to develop my skills along with implementing various visualizations of said data structures. The first language I intend to focus on is Java, following with Python and Swift, for reasons. I will add instructions for cloning the repository and executing files in the primary languages. In terms of downloads and execution, I highly advise viewers curious to fork or clone my repository to do so in the documents folder. This will allow for easier interpretation of instructions and easier execution of programs. 

## Java

I hope to make my own generic implementations of data structures (mostly linear) in Java to demonstrate
my comprehension of how they work and how they can be used. 

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory. 
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to compile. 
```shell
javac <folder-name>/<file-name>.java
```
The final step is to execute the code after it is properly compiled. 
```shell
java <file-name>
```

## Python

I hope to use Python in this repository to learn the object-oriented paradigm in a language that
often recommends its functional and prodecural principles to users. 

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory.
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to interpret and execute.  
```shell
python3 <file-name>.py
```

## Swift

In terms of Swift, I am mostly focused on general programming concepts. I hope that this will demonstrate my 
ability to interpret language syntax and my ability to implement a language in basic applications. 

The first step is to go into /home/Documents in your directory.
```shell
cd ~/Documents/
```
The second step is to choose which folder's driver you want to compile and execute. 
```shell
swift <file-name>.swift
```
